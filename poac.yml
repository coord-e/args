  A simple header-only C++ argument parser library.
  Supposed to be flexible and powerful, and attempts to be compatible with the functionality of the Python standard argparse library (though not necessarily the API).
  This library is created by Taylor C. Richberger <taywee@gmx.com> and Pavel Belikov, and distributed under MIT License.
